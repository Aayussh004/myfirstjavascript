//to understand javascript you need to know:

//that all the code that I am writing here like(console.log("Ayush")) is just a text file but
//it is the responsibility of interpreter or compiler to understand the correct syntax

//dekho ye smjh aana chahiye ki javascript sirf ek language hai to isko execute krne ke liye mujhe ek software ya environment
//ya interpreter ya compiler chahiye jise hum nodejs kehte hai (Ryan Dahl ki khoj) to koi bhi kaam krne se phle shree ganesh 
//yani ki node js ki pooja anivarya hai
